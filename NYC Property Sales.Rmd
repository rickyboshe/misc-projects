New York city is known to be one of the most expensive cities in the world when it comes to real estate. The city has 5 different **boroughs**, with each having its unique socioeconomic profile that helps determine the real estate prices.

Using data shared by the [New York City department of Finance](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page), this project looks to analyze housing costs for the last 12 months and use regression models to predict prices based on indicators.

#Load data

```

The data is found in 4 distinct excel files. Read them to the environment and merge them in a single dataframe, making it easier to handle. 

```{r cleaning, include=TRUE}
#The boroughs are coded (manhattan=1, bronx=2, brooklyn=3, queens=4, staten=5)
nyc<-bind_rows(manhattan,bronx,brooklyn,queens,staten)

#Recode the boroughs
nyc<-nyc%>%
  mutate(
    BOROUGH=case_when(
      BOROUGH=="1" ~ "Manhattan",
      BOROUGH=="2" ~ "Bronx",
      BOROUGH=="3" ~ "Brooklyn",
      BOROUGH=="4" ~ "Queens",
      BOROUGH=="5" ~ "Staten Island"
      )
    )

#remove the individual dataframes
rm(bronx, brooklyn, manhattan, queens, staten)

#Normalize the column names (lower column names and remove space)
colnames(nyc)<-str_to_lower(colnames(nyc))%>%
  str_replace_all("\\s", "_")%>%
  str_to_title(colnames(nyc))

#some of the properties were exchanged between family members (i.e. filter with a threshold of 10,000$)
summary(nyc$Sale_price)
nyc<-nyc%>%
  filter(Sale_price>10000)

#Some properties have square footage of 0, which is unlikely in reality. Remove
summary(nyc$Gross_square_feet)
nyc<-nyc%>%
  filter(Gross_square_feet>0)

#Initial removal of variables that are not of interest
nyc<-nyc%>%
  select(-5,-6,-7,-8,-10)
```

The initial data cleaning and manipulation helps set the data up ready for exploration and followed by analysis.

```{r explore, include=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, message=FALSE}
plot_intro(nyc, ggtheme = theme_bw())

sum(is.na(nyc$Year_built))
nyc<-nyc%>%
  drop_na(Year_built)

table(nyc$Borough)

#Plot continuous and discrete values
plot_histogram(nyc, ggtheme = theme_bw(), ncol = 2)
plot_bar(nyc, maxcat = 5, 
         ggtheme = theme_bw())

#Keep only family dwellings only
nyc<-nyc%>%
  filter(Building_class_category=="01 ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS" | Building_class_category=="02 TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS" | Building_class_category=="03 THREE FAMILY DWELLINGS")%>%
  mutate(Building_class_category=
           case_when(
             Building_class_category=="01 ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS" ~ "One Family Dwellings",
             Building_class_category=="02 TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS" ~ "Two Family Dwellings",
             Building_class_category=="03 THREE FAMILY DWELLINGS" ~ "Three Family Dwellings"
             )
         )

table(nyc$Borough)

plot_bar(nyc, maxcat = 5,
         ncol = 2,
         ggtheme = theme_bw())

```
Very few missing observations (14), and they seem to be from the *Year Built* column. We can go ahead and remove them since they make up just 0.04% of the data.


You can also observe that most variables have very huge outliers that skew their charts positively. Going forward, we might need to deal with the outliers. One potential way is by keeping just residential dwellings (building codes can be found [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/jump/hlpbldgcode.html)). Manhattan will see a considerable drop in observations (<span style="color: red;">76%</span>) while the least drop in observations was for Staten Island (<span style="color: red;">2%</span>).  coincidentally lower the number of observations from Manhattan.
